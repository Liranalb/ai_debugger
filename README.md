# AI Debugger

The AI Debugger is a web application that helps users debug their code by leveraging the power of AI. Users can submit their code and logs to the application, which will then send them to the OpenAI API. The OpenAI model will analyze the code and logs and provide insights on why the code is not working as expected and suggest possible fixes.
